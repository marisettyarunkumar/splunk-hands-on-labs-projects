Project: SSH Log Analysis using Splunk
Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze SSH authentication logs to detect:

Successful logins (who connected, from where)
Failed login attempts (possible brute-force or password spraying)
Multiple failed authentication attempts (indicators of brute-force)
Connections without authentication (potential scanning or incomplete sessions)
By completing this project, you’ll learn how to use Splunk to ingest SSH logs, run queries, create dashboards, and generate alerts.

Lab Setup and Pre-requisite
Complete the Splunk Installation Project
Download the SSH Log File
Preparation
Log in to your Splunk instance (Enterprise or Free).
Go to Apps > Search & Reporting.
Click Add Data → Upload.
Select the provided ssh_log.json file and upload it.
Choose sourcetype = _json so Splunk automatically extracts fields.
Index it under a new index, e.g., ssh_logs.
Review and click on start searching
Step-by-Step Guide
Task 1: Ingest and Parse Logs
Upload ssh_log.json into Splunk.
Ensure the following fields are extracted correctly:
event_type (Successful SSH Login, Failed SSH Login, Multiple Failed Authentication Attempts, Connection Without Authentication)
auth_success (true/false/null)
auth_attempts
id.orig_h (source IP)
id.resp_h (destination host)
Run a validation search:
index=ssh_log | stats count by event_type
Task 2: Analyze Failed Login Attempts
Identify all failed login attempts:

index=ssh_logs event_type="Failed SSH Login"
| stats count by id.orig_h
Highlight the top 10 source IPs generating failed logins.

Create a bar chart visualization for failed login attempts per source IP.

Task 3: Detect Multiple Failed Authentication Attempts (Brute Force)
Search for multiple failed attempts in logs:

index=ssh_logs event_type="Multiple Failed Authentication Attempts"
| stats count by id.orig_h, id.resp_h
Detect repeated failures (e.g., more than 5 attempts).

Configure a Splunk alert:

Trigger when any IP attempts more than 5 logins within 10 minutes.

Task 4: Track Successful Logins
Search for successful logins:

index=ssh_logs event_type="Successful SSH Login"
| stats count by id.orig_h, id.resp_h
Compare successful logins against prior failed attempts (to detect compromised accounts).

Create a dashboard panel showing top source IPs for successful logins.

Task 5: Spot Suspicious Connections Without Authentication
Search for unauthenticated SSH connections:

index=ssh_logs event_type="Connection Without Authentication"
| stats count by id.orig_h
Create a timechart visualization to monitor such events over time:

index=ssh_logs event_type="Connection Without Authentication"
| timechart count by id.orig_h
Identify repeated unauthenticated attempts — potential indicators of port scanning or SSH probing.

Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have:

Built dashboards to monitor SSH activity.

Identified brute-force login attempts and suspicious access attempts.

Configured Splunk alerts for high-risk behavior.

Learned how to parse, search, visualize, and alert on SSH logs in Splunk.

This project provides practical SOC Analyst–level log analysis skills and strengthens your cybersecurity portfolio.
